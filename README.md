# Signa for John Deere
Android App to help anyone learn Mexican Sign Language. Developed with video material from John Deere (and for John Deere, originally).

• Developed it myself using Jetpack Compose, Kotlin, Android Studio, and the OkHttp library.

• My teammates created the supporting web app, API, formal documentation (such as the SRS doc.), and supervised security concerns.

## Learning Mexican Sign Language doesn't have to be boring!
